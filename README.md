# NPCRoom
For testing:
To test frontend, open the npcroomui folder.
to be on the safe side, call:
    npm install react
    npm install react-router-dom
    npm install @mui/material
    npm install @emotion/react
    npm install @emotion/styled
Call npm start. Hopefully the UI will load up (it may take a while but I will see if that can be fixed)

Backend can be ran in either a Java IDE (like IntelliJ) or VSCode. Just run the NPCRoomApplication.java file, and make sure that at the very
least Spring Boot and Apache Tomcat start.
